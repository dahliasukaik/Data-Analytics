## Logistic Regression Activity

I have intentionally not provided you much in this repo. 
You have two tasks:

1. Calculate specificity, sensitivity, and accuracy of `rain_model_1`
2. Fit `rain_model_2` which can be any model of your choice. The constraint is that `rain_model_2` has to outperform `rain_model_1`.
